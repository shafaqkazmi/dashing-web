### FRONT END TEST

THE PURPOSE OF THIS ASSESSMENT IS TO EVALUATE YOUR SKILLS IN LOGIC, CODING
STYLE, AND DEVELOPMENT OF INTERACTIVE WEB APPLICATIONS, AND FOR US TO KNOW
HOW YOU STRUCTURE YOUR CODE AND COMPONENTS.
Host your code on a Github repository, provide us access to it and provide a simple README on how we
can run and test your web app. You will have 24 hours to complete this exam. Regardless of completion
status, please submit the link to your public repository to our HR.
THE TASK WILL ASSESS YOU ON:
- UI & UX Design.
- API calling & authentication.
- Cashing and browser storage utilization.
Case 1: Simple Login Page
• Build a responsive login page where users can input their username and password.
• Implement password validation that requires a minimum of 8 characters with at least 1
uppercase letter, 1 lowercase letter, and 1 special character.
Note:
• Showcase your creativity and expertise in UI/UX design, incorporating animations/transitions on
the page.
Case 2: Role-Based Access and Sortable Table
• Upon successful login, the application should handle different roles (Viewer, Editor) and display a
sortable table.
• The Editor role should be able to perform (Insert, Edit, and Delete).
• Implement a search functionality to filter the table list.
• All fields in the table should be sortable.
Note:
• Demonstrate your skills in consuming REST APIs. Avoid using hardcoded data.
• Ensure the web application is Responsive, and works well on modern desktop browsers and
mobile devices.
• Do not use any CSS Frameworks. We want to see your handwritten styling abilities. You are only
allowed to use React core libraries that come with CRA (Create React App).
• Code should be written using up-to-date stacks, including ES6, Typescript, HTML5, and SCSS.

Below is a low fidelity mockup you may use as your reference. Feel free to do your design as long as the
expected functionality is there.

Upon receiving these instructions, you are expected to complete this test within 24 hours.
Please complete the assessment within the given timeframe and showcase your expertise in developing
interactive and user-friendly web applications. We are excited to see what you create!
